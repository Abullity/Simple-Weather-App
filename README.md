# Simple-Weather-App
A simple python backend project inspired by one of JetBrains Academy projects.

Frontend styles as well as basic idea comes from JetBrains Academy,
logic/backend of the app is provided by me with the help of Flask framework

# Installation and dependencies

App uses Flask as the backend framework

The required modules (Including Flask and Flask_Sqlalchemy) are given in requirements.txt file,
which was generated by 'pip freeze' command.

To install required modules run 'pip -r requirements.txt' command from project root directory

App also uses data from OpenWeatherApi, which is essential to run the app,
so in order to get a valid API key,
you must register at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up


Once you get your API key, assign your API key to API_KEY variable on line 41 in WeatherApp/helpers.py  

After you have every package installed and API_KEY variable assign with valid key, execute run.py file, the rest should work without issues.


# What does the app do

App takes existing city name as an input and generates a card of a given city with:

  • temperature
  
  • colloqual description of the temperature
  
  • background image which correlates to local time of the city
  
  
All the generated cards will be saved in a sqlite database,
so they should be there after termination and relaunch of the program

You could also delete a city card which is no longer needed and it'll also be deleted from the database

Everytime you refresh the page or add/delete a card, data of every saved card will also be updated
